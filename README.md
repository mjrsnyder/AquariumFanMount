# Aquarium Fan Mount
A bracket for mounting a computer case fan to a rimless aquarium.

Inspired by [devid89's aquarium fan mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:467586), I designed a similar model that can be adapted to different sized fans and has an adjustable fan angle.

This design accomodates common sizes of case fans (80, 92, 120, 140) with no modification and can be modified to accomodate fans of varying thicknesses.  


### Instructions:
The files should work as-is for 5mm thick glass and a 25mm thick fan.

* In `AquariumFanMount-Clip.scad` set `glass_thickness` to the desired thickness
* In `AquariumFanMount-Fan.scad` set `depth` to the thickness of your fan

### Required Hardware:
* 2 - M4x15mm stainless steel or nylon screws (holds the clip and mount together)
* 2 - M4x40mm stainless steel or nylon screws (holds the fan in the mount)
* 4 - M4 stainless steel or nylon nuts
* 1 - Threadlock (optional)
